* Cancelled Deliveries
* Customer Rating
* Complaint Count
* Fraud Flags
* Days Active
* High-Priority Jobs Done
* Pod Scan Miss Rate

#### üßê ML Model

* **Random Forest Regressor**
* R¬≤ Score: **0.994**
* MAE: **0.34**

#### üß™ Sample Request

```json
{
  "total_deliveries": 120,
  "on_time_deliveries": 110,

  ]
}
```

#### üß™ Sample Request

```json
{
  "total_orders": 55,
  "return_count": 12,
  "avg_return_time_days": 2.5,
